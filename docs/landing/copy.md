Stop managing AI chaos in chat threads. ClawCondos gives your agents structured workspaces, clear objectives, and session continuity—so work actually gets done.

## Features

### 🏠 Condos
**Workspaces that make sense**
Group related work into dedicated spaces. Each condo is a self-contained project with its own goals, sessions, and context. No more agents stepping on each other's toes.

### 🎯 Goals
**Direction, not drift**
Define what "done" looks like. Goals give your agents purpose—clear objectives they can track, update, and complete. Finally, accountability for your AI workforce.

### 💬 Sessions
**Conversations with continuity**
Every session attaches to a goal. Context persists. Progress compounds. Your agents pick up where they left off instead of starting from scratch.

### 📊 Dashboard
**Visibility across everything**
See what's running, what's blocked, and what's shipped—all in one view. Know exactly what your agents are doing without digging through logs.
